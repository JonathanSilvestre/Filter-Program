Hi everybody this is Jonathan 

This program was made for a homework of my computer architecture class

We need to have a File .txt with the next format:

Write here the information that we don't want to show in the console

@parameter
 Write here the information that we want to show in the console
@parameter_end

Write here the information that we don't want to show in the console.


For run this program we need to compile this program Parametros.c
and run it with the following command (in windows): Parametros parameter < TheNameofFile.txt
When we run the program in console it should only show the information that we put in between @parameter and @parameter_end

I hope this program helps everybody.
